<h1>PoliThinks</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This dashboard presents a comprehensive and centralized database of all local politicians in the Philippines, designed as a research-oriented tool for examining patterns of political power, kinship, and governance. Beyond serving as a directory of political profiles, it enables users to explore the intricate web of familial ties, shared surnames, and career overlaps that characterize political dynasties across the country. Through its built-in analytical tools, users can visualize network relationships between politicians, identify clusters of interconnected families, and observe how these networks evolve across election cycles. The platform also offers provincial-level dynasty mapping, allowing researchers, students, and policymakers to compare the concentration, reach, and persistence of dynasties in different regions. By integrating profile data with network visualization, the dashboard provides a deeper and more systematic way of understanding how political influence is distributed, inherited, and reproduced within the Philippine political landscape.
